Face recognition app is small project that that I created in process of learning ReactJs. It uses ReactJs in combianation whit tachyons css toolkit for UI and NodeJs/Express.js for backend which takes care of basic CRUD operations. Project is part of ZTM(Zero to Mastery) Udemy course by Andrei Neagoi.
